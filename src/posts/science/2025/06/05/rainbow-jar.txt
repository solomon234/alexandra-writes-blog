Today I did a super cool science experiment! I made a rainbow in a jar using water, 
food coloring, and different amounts of sugar. The colors didn't mix together because 
of something called "density" - my dad explained it to me.

First, I put red water with lots of sugar at the bottom. Then I carefully added orange 
with a little less sugar, then yellow, green, blue, and purple at the top with almost no sugar.

It looks SO COOL on my windowsill! The sunlight makes it sparkle. I'm going to show it 
to my science class next week.
