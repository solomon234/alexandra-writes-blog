Roses are red,  
Violets are blue.  
I love you with all my heart,  
But I have no idea how to express that to you.

When I see you in the summer,  
It's like you're the sun,  
But your eyes are as deep as the sea beneath.  
If I didn't have you,  
I don't know what I'd be.

You make me glow,  
You make me shine,  
You make me feel brighter than any star in the night.  
You make me think that there's nothing else that I can't do for you.  
You are the light in my day. ❤
