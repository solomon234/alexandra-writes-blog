Today I went to the Enchanted Forest with my family! It was SO amazing! 
We saw butterflies with rainbow wings and tiny houses in the trees that might be for fairies.

My favorite part was when we found a little stream with sparkly rocks. I collected three of them 
and named them Sparkles, Glimmer, and Bob. Mom says I can keep them in a special jar on my desk.

Next time, I want to bring my magnifying glass to look for more magical creatures!
