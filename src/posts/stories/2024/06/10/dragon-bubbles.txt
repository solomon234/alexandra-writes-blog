I wrote a new story today! It's about a dragon named Puff who can't breathe fire. 
Instead of fire, he breathes bubbles! At first, all the other dragons laugh at him, 
but then there's a big fire in the forest, and Puff saves everyone with his bubbles.

My teacher said it was very creative and gave me a gold star! I'm going to write 
more stories about Puff and his adventures.

What do you think Puff should do in his next adventure? Leave a comment below!
